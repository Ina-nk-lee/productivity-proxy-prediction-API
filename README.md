# Project 1 Spec

**Title:** Productivity Proxy Prediction API for Students

---

## 1. User & Decision

This API is designed for students who want to manage their study
schedules more effectively. As a student, predicting _"How productive
will I be today?"_ can help decide whether to push through assignments,
take breaks, or reduce distractions. The goal is not to perfectly
measure true productivity, but to provide a **proxy productivity score**
based on lifestyle inputs. Even with limited resources (free-tier cloud
services), this API should deliver useful insights without excessive
cost.

---

## 2. Target & Horizon

- **Target**: A **daily productivity proxy score** (0-10) based on
  self-reported stress, attention span, or productivity scores from
  open datasets.
- **Horizon**: 12-24 hours (today or the next day).
- **Justification**: Productivity cannot be objectively measured at
  scale, but proxy labels offer a practical and ethical way to
  approximate it.

---

## 3. Features (No Leakage)

- **Core inputs**:
  - `sleep_hours` (previous night)
  - `caffeine_mg` (consumed today)
  - `screen_time_hours` (today or previous day)
- **Optional**: bedtime, notification counts.
- **No leakage**: All features are past or current values; no future
  data is used.

---

## 4. Baseline â†’ Model Plan

- **Baseline**: Rule-based model.
  - sleep < 6h â†’ lower score
  - caffeine 0-200mg â†’ slightly higher score; > 400mg â†’ lower
    score
  - screen_time > 6h â†’ lower score
- **Model**: Lightweight regression (Linear Regression).
- **Deployment**: Model exported to ONNX for small size and fast
  inference in serverless environments.

---

## 5. Metrics, SLA, and Cost

- **Metrics**: RMSE / MAE (continuous), Brier score (probabilities).
- **SLA**:
  - p95 latency â‰¤ 300ms
  - cold start < 1s
  - availability â‰¥ 99%
- **Cost envelope**: service remains within serverless **free-tier**; target â‰ˆ **$0/month** under normal student load; **monitored with synthetic probes every 1 minute @ ~1k req/min**; on viral spikes (**e.g., 50k req/h**) automatically **degrade to baseline (rules-only)** to cap compute and avoid overage; **stateless** by design (raw=0d; aggregates â‰¤30d).
- **Cost constraints (student reality)**:
  - Free-tier limits on AWS Lambda or Vercel (millions of free
    invocations/month).
  - No GPU usage; CPU-only inference.
  - No paid monitoring; instead, lightweight logging.
- **Viral spike survival**: In case of 50k req/h, switch to rule-based
  fallback that runs instantly with no compute cost.

## 6. API Sketch

**Endpoint:** `POST /v1/predict`

**Request**:

```json
{
  "sleep_hours": 6.2,
  "caffeine_mg": 120,
  "screen_time_hours": 5.5
}
```

**Response**:

```json
{
  "proxy_productivity_score": 6.8,
  "uncertainty": 0.2,
  "risk_factors": ["late_bedtime", "high_screen_time"],
  "suggestion": "Reducing screen time by 1h could increase score by ~0.5"
}
```

---

## 7. Privacy, Ethics, Reciprocity (PIA excerpt)

(ðŸ“Ž **See full PIA: https://github.com/Ina-nk-lee/productivity-proxy-prediction-API/blob/main/PIA.pdf**)

- **Data Collected**: sleep_hours, caffeine_mg, screen_time_hours (lifestyle only, no PII)
- **Purpose**: predict proxy productivity score (0â€“10)
- **Retention**: none for raw inputs (0 days); aggregates kept â‰¤ 30 days
- **Access**: developer-only; no third-party sharing
- **Guardrails**: input validation (reject outliers), jitter/noise for aggregates, opt-in telemetry only
- **Disclaimer**: This API predicts a _proxy productivity score_, not medical or clinical outcomes.

---

## 8. Architecture & Feasibility

**Architecture**:

- Client â†’ API Gateway â†’ Serverless (AWS Lambda or Vercel) â†’ ONNX model

**Degrade mode**:

- If free-tier compute limits are reached or latency spikes, switch to
  baseline rule predictions.

**Trade-offs**:

- Serverless (cheap, scales automatically) vs container (expensive, not
  feasible for free-tier students).
- For students, serverless is the only realistic option; cold starts are
  acceptable if rare.

---

## 9. Risks & Mitigations

- **Risk**: Dataset labels (stress, attention) are proxies, not true
  productivity.
  - _Mitigation_: Acknowledge in documentation; use assumption
    audit.
- **Risk**: Free-tier limits exceeded.
  - _Mitigation_: Automatic degrade mode to baseline rules.
- **Risk**: Noisy self-report features.
  - _Mitigation_: Provide uncertainty values; clip extreme inputs.

---

## 10. Measurement Plan

- **Minimal experiment**:
  - Train/test split on Kaggle dataset with productivity-related
    proxies.
  - Compare baseline RMSE vs model RMSE.
- **SLA test**:
  - **Synthetic probes every 1 minute @ ~1k req/min** to measure p95 latency & cold start.
  - Simulate free-tier limits; measure latency under ~1k req/min.
  - Test fallback baseline mode for stability.

---

## 11. Evolution & Evidence

- Reframed anxiety â†’ productivity proxy.
- Added non-linear caffeine effect.
- Chose serverless + fallback over containers.
- Differentiated from CalmCast (inputs & horizon).

## âœ¦ Conclusion

This API provides a realistic, low-cost solution for predicting daily
productivity proxies based on lifestyle inputs. It acknowledges the
limits of using stress and attention span as proxies, while still
offering practical value to students. The architecture is feasible under
free-tier constraints, with fallback strategies to handle viral load.
The design covers rubric requirements in problem framing, specification
clarity, privacy/ethics, baseline evaluation, architecture, risks, and
evolution.

## Minimal Evaluation Plan

**Baseline**

- Rule-based: sleep < 6h â†’ scoreâ†“, caffeine > 400mg â†’ scoreâ†“, screen_time > 6h â†’ scoreâ†“

**Model**

- Lightweight regression (Linear/XGBoost), exported to ONNX

**Metrics**

- RMSE / MAE (continuous proxy score)
- SLA metric: p95 latency â‰¤ 300ms, cold start < 1s

**Evaluation**

- Train/test split on open dataset (proxy labels: stress, attention span, productivity)
- Compare RMSE of baseline vs model
- **SLA measurement**: **synthetic probes every 1 minute @ ~1k req/min**
- Load test: simulate 1k req/min (fits free-tier), test viral spike (50k req/h) with fallback

**Cost envelope**

- **Within free-tier** (~**$0/month** under normal student load); measured alongside SLA probes; if projected overage, automatically **degrade to baseline** and reduce telemetry frequency; stateless inputs (raw=0d; aggregates â‰¤30d).

### Insight Memo, Assumption Audit, Socratic Log, Git Evidence

#### Insight Memo (3 Key Insights)

1. **Proxy â‰  Productivity**: Productivity cannot be measured directly. Using stress, attention span, and self-reported scores as proxies makes the target tractable but requires honesty about limitations.
2. **Free-tier Constraints Shape Architecture**: Designing for AWS Lambda/Vercel with fallback rules ensures the system remains viable for students without paid infrastructure. Cost limitations fundamentally influenced design choices.
3. **Baseline vs Model Trade-off**: Rule-based baselines are explainable and resilient at scale, while lightweight ML models add nuance. Maintaining both supports reliability under viral load.

#### Assumption Audit

- **Sleep hours â†‘ â†’ Productivity proxy score â†‘** (assumed positive linear relation).
- **Caffeine has non-linear effect**: moderate intake improves score; excessive intake lowers score.
- **Screen time hours â†‘ â†’ Productivity proxy score â†“** (assumed negative correlation).
- **Inputs are self-reported and noisy**: must include uncertainty estimates and rejection of outliers.

#### Socratic Log References

**Q1:** Could I predict anxiety disorder from sleep, caffeine, and screen time?  
**A1:** That would raise serious ethical issues (medical diagnosis, misuse risk).  
âž¡ **Insight:** Avoid framing as clinical/medical prediction.

**Q2:** What if I reframe it as productivity prediction?  
**A2:** Productivity is vague, but you can use _stress/attention span/productivity scores_ as proxies.  
âž¡ **Insight:** Define the target explicitly as a **proxy productivity score**.

**Q3:** Isnâ€™t caffeine always linked to higher productivity?  
**A3:** Not directly. Moderate caffeine can improve focus, but excessive caffeine worsens sleep and productivity.  
âž¡ **Insight:** Capture caffeineâ€™s **non-linear effect** in baseline rules.

**Q4:** Should I deploy the model in containers instead of serverless?  
**A4:** Containers are stable but exceed free-tier constraints. For students, serverless + fallback is more practical.  
âž¡ **Insight:** Architecture shaped by **free-tier cost guardrails**.

**Q5:** Is this project too similar to CalmCast from the idea list?  
**A5:** CalmCast uses smartphone activity logs, while yours uses lifestyle factors (sleep, caffeine, screen time). Different framing, but important to clarify.  
âž¡ **Insight:** Explicitly highlight difference from prior idea to avoid overlap.
